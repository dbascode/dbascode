# DbAsCode
### Database As Code

A tool to manage database structure "as code" in `yaml` config files, allowing easy VCS storage, changes 
tracking, and automation. The main goal is to manage the structure. Data migrations (by using custom 
migrations) are also supported.

## Goals

This project is aiming to solve the following problems in database lifetime support:

- Having the full human-readable DB structure at any point of time (commit). In conventional migration systems
you can not see the structure until you connect to a physical DB instance with all the migrations applied. 
Or you have to export SQL structure manually.
- Changes tracking. You can easily compare Yaml configuration files between commits and 
clearly understand what the exact changes were made. In conventional migration systems you can not do that without 
special workarounds on exporting SQL DB structure on each build and store it somewhere. Or you have to 
deploy backups.  
- Convenient changes comparison. Raw SQL migrations or structure dumps, XML files are 
not so convenient to read changes in comparison to Yaml. With Yaml, you will see only those changed lines, 
which actually have changed something in the DB.

### Why not Liquibase or Flyway?   

- Liquibase requires to describe migrations manually. You just move conventional old-style SQL migrations  
to another syntax (XML or Yaml). It doesn't solve any problems mentioned above.
- Flyway operates with SQL migrations. The same, it does some automation, but still doesn't work for our goals.

### Why not an ORM with migrations?

ORMs with migrations support can be used to achieve our goals, but there are cases when we don't need their main 
functionality - object relations mapping used in some code. DbAsCode is focusing on describing DB structure without any 
relations to programming languages and data models.

## Project State

This project is currently on the very early development stage. It is not recommended to use it in production.

## Supported Database Types

Currently, only PostgreSQL is supported. Other DBMS support should arrive in the future.

## Installation

Using NPM:
```shell script
npm i dbascode
```

Using Yarn:
```shell script
yarn add dbascode
```

Install PostgreSQL client:

```shell script
apt-get install postgresql-client
```

You also can use the pre-configured Docker image. See Docker documentation if you're not yet familiar with it. 

## Usage

Running with NPM:
```shell script
npm run dbascode
```

Running with Yarn:
```shell script
yarn dbascode
```

Running with Docker:
```shell script
docker run pgascode
```

### Command line options

CLI syntax:

```shell script
dbascode <command> [options]
```

#### Commands

Command | Description
--------|------------
`plan <source>` | Compare old and new states and create migration plan. New state is read from the `source` file path. If the `---output` option specified, creates the plan file to be used for migration.
`migrate` | Performs migration. Either `--plan` or `--migration` options must be specified for migration. If a plan is specified, pgascode will read SQL queries to execute from it. If other migration was performed since creation of the state file, the migration will fail. If a source is specified, pgascode will generate migration plan and execute it immediately.

#### Options

Option | Description | Example
-------|-------------|-------
`--help` | Display CLI help.
`--version` | Display the tool version.
`--db-var` | Database configuration parameter (see particular DB plugin documentation). Multiple options are allowed. | `--db-var host=db.id.ap-northeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com --db-var db=mydbname --db-var user=root --db-var password=123`
`--plugin` | List of plugins to be loaded. Module names to import must be provided. | `--plugin=myplugin1 --plugin=myplugin2`
`--dbms` | The Database Management System name if it is not mentioned in the state config. | `--dbms=postgres`
`--wsl` | Pass true if DbAsCode is run under Windows but PostgreSQL client should be run under WSL. | `--wsl=1`
`--output` | Plan only. Specifies file name to store the migration plan. | `--output=/var/plan.json`
`--source` | Migrate only. Specifies the source file to be used for plan creation if no plan is passed for the migration. | `--source=/my-project/db.yml`
`--plan` | Migrate only. Specifies the plan file generated by the `plan` command and saved with the `--output` option. Determine changes to be made in the DB. | `--plan=/var/plan.json`

#### Environment Variables

If PgAsCode will not find CLI options passed it will look for options in environment variables. Options are passed using 
the `DBAC_` variable name prefix and an option name in uppercase (hyphen is replaced by underscore):

```shell script
$ DBAC_DB_VAR="host=some.host|port=5432|password=123" DBAC_DBMS=postgres DBAC_PLAN=/var/plan.json pgascode migrate
```

Options `--plugins` and `--db-var` should be passed as single variables with list values separated by the `|` character.
